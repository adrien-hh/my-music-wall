## About the Project

My Music Wall is a personal web application designed to let users create and visualize their own music library.  
The goal is to reduce friction: one album, one click, one action.  

The interface focuses on **album covers**, avoiding complex menus or unnecessary features.  
Perfect for music lovers who enjoy collecting, discovering, and visually browsing albums.
